LINUX PERMISSION BITS
A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with 
values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits  are  assumed  to  be  leading
zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted 
deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permis‚Äê
sions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects 
permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same
values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the same values.
